                    <p>ðŸ‘‹ I love building, from the first spark of an idea to shaping it into something real and refining it for impact. My studies in computer science and mathematics help me approach problems with both creativity and precision, and Iâ€™m especially interested in applications across SWE, quantitative finance, and technology-driven consulting.</p>

        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Iâ€™m Kai Zhou, a student at Northwestern University studying computer science and mathematics. Iâ€™m drawn to problems that require both structure and creativity, which is why I focus on the intersection of technology and finance.
My professional interests include software engineering, quantitative development and trading, and management consulting, with a focus on AI implementation and risk management. I see these fields as opportunities to keep learning while building solutions that matter.
Outside of academics, I enjoy running, working out, playing squash, and solving puzzles.</p>
