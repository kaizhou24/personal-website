        <p>CS + Math @ Northwestern</p>
        <p>ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Kai Zhou, studying Computer Science and Mathematics at Northwestern. I love building things and exploring the intersection of CS, math, and finance. My current interests include software engineering, quantitative finance, and technology consulting.</p>

        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Iâ€™m Kai Zhou, a Northwestern student studying computer science and mathematics. At my core, Iâ€™m someone who loves building and experimenting â€” whether thatâ€™s developing software, exploring quantitative models, or working on projects that connect technology and human values.
My professional interests lie in software engineering, quantitative finance, and management consulting, with a focus on data analytics, artificial intelligence, and risk. These fields let me combine technical rigor with problem-solving at scale.
Beyond CS and math, Iâ€™m fascinated by philosophy â€” especially ethics, logic, metaphysics, and epistemology. Philosophy shapes how I approach complexity, grounding my work in reasoning and fairness.
Outside academics, I keep active with running, the gym, and squash. I also enjoy baking, puzzles, and strategy games, which challenge me in different ways and keep my problem-solving skills sharp.</p>
